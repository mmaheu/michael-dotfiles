* Ubuntu Configurations
  These are the standard things I do to a new Ubuntu installation


** Basic Things First

*** Update Apt and Install Base Applications

**** Java
      sudo apt-add-repository ppa:webupd8team/java
      sudo apt-get update
      sudo apt-get install oracle-java8-installer

**** Grails
     curl -s get.gvmtool.net | bash
     source ~/.gvm/bin/gvm-init.sh
     gvm install grails


**** Node
      sudo apt-get install build-essential libssl-dev
      curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.16.1/install.sh | sh

    - source ~/.profile
    - nvm ls-remote

    - nvm install 0.11.13
    - nvm use 0.11.13
    - nvm alias default 0.11.13
    - nvm use default

**** VIM
     set tCo=256 in my .vimrc if it is not there. This will allow for Jellybean theme in the terminal


*** Directories and Locations
    These locations include cloud synced files. I use Dropbox, Ownloud, and Google Drive (Docs)

    - Dropbox has all pictures and markdown files in the Notes directory
    - Owncloud has personall files and documents
    - Google has google documents and spreadsheets
    - Github has the mike-maheu repo which has all of my .org

**** Installation of Cloud Storage and Git


*** Emacs org-mode / Git / Apache / Auto Sync
    This is how I setup my org files on git. They get auto synced via git to the Prometheus server
    From there I have a simlink to the gtd.html which gets exported from Emacs org-mode and then pushed
    This allows me to work in Emacs, as well as have a webpage for my GTD. This page is protected by Apache

    - Keep all org files on Github in the mike-maheu repo
    - Clone to the Prometheus server
    - Apache has a virtual host setup for gtd.michaelmaheu.com

     Apache Config
     #+BEGIN_SRC
      <virtualhost *:80>
       servername gtd.yourserver.com
       serveradmin admin@yourserver.com
       documentroot /var/www/gtd
        <Directory /var/www/gtd>
         AllowOverride All
        </Directory>
      </virtualhost>
     #+END_SRC

      HTACESS
      #+BEGIN_SRC
       AuthUserFile /home/some_user/.safe/.htpasswd
       AuthName "Authorization Required"
       AuthType Basic
       Require valid-user
      #+END_SRC

      HTPASSWD
      #+BEGIN_SRC
       htpasswd -c /home/pwww/.htpasswd user
       htpasswd /home/pwww/.htpasswd-users user
      #+END_SRC

    - Finally there is the cron and bash script
      The bash script just CDs into the mike-maheu directory and executes git command
      the user must be added to the /etc/group file @ the cron line. If not you will get permission denied
      when cron tries to run the script

    - Add to personall cron tab with crontab -e (In this case it will run every 15 minutes)
