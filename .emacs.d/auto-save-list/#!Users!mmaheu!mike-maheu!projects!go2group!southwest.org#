* Initial Onsite Assessment Meetings
  Southwest Airlines is trying to move to the Atlassian stack inlcuding Git/Stash. They are interested in automating the implemenation
  of the tools. In other words they want to spin up a virtual invironment that would inlude a JIRA,Confluence, and Stash instance.
  The tools will be auto configure including licenses and projects. This will be done with Chef and some customizations with a particular
  Gem library.
